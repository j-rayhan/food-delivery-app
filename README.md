# Let's Code React-Native

we are going to build a good looking Food Delivery App based on the design created by ILia on Dribbble.

**Note: This app is using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) instead npm, [GoogleMap](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps), [GoogleMapDirections](https://github.com/bramus/react-native-maps-directions)**

# Installation & Start
